<h2>My favourite movie these days:</h2>
<a id="Favourite movie"></a>
<h2>Encanto</h2>
	<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2953050/">Encanto on IMDB</a>
	<p> Encanto is a very inspiring movie. It seems like a kids movie but 
		it is an amazing movie for adults.
	The main charachter is Mirable, a Colombian teenage girl has to face the frustration of being the only member of her family without magical powers. You'll meet her family members, find out their special powers and I am sure you will find at least one charachter to identify with. </p>

	<p> This is Luisa, Mirable's sister. Her power is strenght. She lifts, carries, and never breaks.</p>
	<p> Quoting her: �Why Would Anything Be Wrong? I�m Totally Fine. The Magic�s Fine. Luisa�s Fine. I�m Totally Not Nervous."</p>
